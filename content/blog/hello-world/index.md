How’s business? Boomin. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Eliptical talk. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door.

Surround yourself with angels. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Another one. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.

Special cloth alert. They don’t want us to win. They don’t want us to win. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Don’t ever play yourself. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat.
